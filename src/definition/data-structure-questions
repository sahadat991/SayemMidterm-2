Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A: We need data structure to our data can make the algorithms much simpler, easier to maintain and often faster.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A: Traversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, Sorting, Merging

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A:            - Compiler Design
              - Operating System
              - Database management system
              - Statistical analysis package
              - Numerical analysis
              - Artificial intelligence
              - Simulation

what is an Array?
A: Array is data structure where elements are stored sequentially

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A: Array is not dynamic, Array List is dynamic

what is LinkedList?
A:  An order set of data elements , each containing a link to its successor

How is an Array different from Linked List?

what is queue?
A: Java Queue is an interface

what is stack?
A: Stack is a data structure

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A: FIFO - First in first out
   LIFO - Last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
A: Finding the upper limit for the growth of some function

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A: Depends if the desired element is the first element in the array then that case would be the best for searching element of an array

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A: The worst case running time of an algorithm is the function defined by the maximum number of steps taken on any instance of size n

what is tree in data structure?
A: A tree data structure is a powerful tool for organizing data objects based on keys. It is equally useful for organizing multiple data objects in terms of hierarchical relationships. Tree is a abstract data types

what is graph in data structure?
A:  Graph is a non linear data structure, contain of set of arrays and set of edges

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A:  Hash Table: Hash table is synchronize Has table cannot contain any null value and null key.
    Hash Map: Hash map is not synchronized. Hash map can contain one key value and multiple null values


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java?

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

What is difference between an array and a linked list?

What is DFS and BFS?
A: Depth first search (DFS): The aim of DFS algorithm is to traverse the graph in such a way that is tries to go far from the root node. Stack is used in the implementation of depth first search.
   Breadth first search (BFS): This very different approach for traversing the graph nodes. The aim of BFS algorithm is to traverse the graph as close as possible to the root node. Queue is used in the implementation of the breadth first search

What is Recursion?
A: The idea of calling one function from another immediately suggests the possibility of a function calling itself. The function-call mechanism in Java supports this possibility, which is known as recursion

What are linear and non linear data Structures?

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A: Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A: Quick sort,Merge sort,Heap sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
